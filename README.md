Classification of handwritten digits using convolutional neural networks. 

This project shows how to use Keras to classify images of handwritten digits.
There is Jupyter notebooks. The cell download the data and store it using pickle. The second cell loads the data and implements the convolutional neural network. The results are obtained by running the learned algorithm on the test data.
The obtained accuracy is 99.38% on th etest data (10 class calssification problem).
