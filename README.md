# convolutionalnetworks_mnist
Classification of handwritten digits using convolutional neural networks. 

This project shows how to use Keras to classify images of handwritten digits.
There are two Jupyter notebooks. The first named "download_mnist" can be used to download the data and store it using pickle. The second document loads the data and implements the convolutional neural network. The results are obtained by running the learned algorithm on the test data.
