# Convolutional Networks MNIST.
Classification of handwritten digits using convolutional neural networks. 


This project shows how to use Keras to classify images of handwritten digits. The code is in the notebook called deepConvNet.ipynb. 
Also, you can see the notebook in colab following this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jfdelgad/convolutionalnetworks_mnist/blob/master/deepConvNet.ipynb)
