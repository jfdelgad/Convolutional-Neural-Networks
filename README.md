# Convolutional Networks MNIST.
Classification of handwritten digits using convolutional neural networks. 


This project shows how to use Keras to classify images of handwritten digits. The network achieves 99.44% accuracy on the test set. The code is in the notebook called deepConvNet.ipynb. Also, you can see the notebook in colab following this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jfdelgad/convolutionalnetworks_mnist/blob/master/deepConvNet.ipynb)
